This was a project I had been thinking about for a long time, the idea of semanticlly analyzing  
a song. The idea is this app finds the song, strips out the grammatical words  
then runs a word count, with the idea that the song is "about" the most common words.  
This is just basic stuff, no semantic web. Nonetheless, while it was fun to build,   
it was only partially successful, as often the most common words were "la" or "love" or a  
name. This could work, of course, but it would need to be much more sophisticated, to strip out a   
lot of the nonsense and to link words together by semantic theme. Perhaps another day.
